============

This is my project for building my own personal blog.  I could use any blogging friendly CMS but as a developer and a person willing to learn some Django development basics, I think it's good for me to program my own with Django.

I'm following the "Get started with Django" tutorial from Jamie Curle on Creative Bloq: http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/get-started-django-7132932

A really great tutorial, I really enjoyed it's methodology.

For development I'm using JetBrains PyCharm atm, so you'll see some IDE metadata on the project (.idea folder)
